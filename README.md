# Garage-Management
C# project - Garage management system
This project is a part of the course: OOP in c#
The project is a garage manager with fully separated between the UI and the logic. 
The system create and manage garage of vehicles.If in the future we would like to add another type of vehicle,
we will add this type as a class that extend vehicle abstract class. In that case minor changes in logic is needed (only in VehicleFactoryclass)
